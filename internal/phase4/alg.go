	// It results in a compact drawing but with less long straight edges.

	// NetworkSimplex sets X coordinates by constructing an auxiliary graph and solving it with the network simplex method.
	// Layers in the auxiliary graph are X coordinates in the main graph. Might be time-intensive for graphs above a few dozen nodes.
	NetworkSimplex

	// SinkColoring is a variant of BrandesKÃ¶pf that aligns nodes based on vertical blocks starting from the bottom.
	// It results in a larger drawing but with more long vertical edge paths. Runs in O(2kn) with 1 <= k <= maxshifts.
	SinkColoring

	// PackRight aligns nodes to the right.
