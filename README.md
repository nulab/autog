# autog

autog (auto-graph) is a Go library to automatically draw hierarchical diagrams.
Given a directed graph as input, autog computes the nodes X and Y coordinates that result in a visually readable, and hopefully pleasant, layout.

As it stands, most of this project is a port of [ELK (Eclipse Layout Kernel)](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.elk) in Go.
